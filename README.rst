Python-MySQL-Docker Template

What This Repo Is
*****************
This repo is a template for building Docker images for Python and MySQL on a Docker network, both of which can have data loaded into them from the outset--the former through a Git clone, the latter through included data definition language and data manipulation language files. While the most basic form of this template creates programs that will contained on a single workstation, this template serves as a slightly more sophisticated version of Python's own virtual environments, as they include a linked SQL database and can have their own changes tracked through version control.
